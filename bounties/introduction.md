**The Tellor Bounties program** is a way to reward developers who help us build out Tellor and is funded from a portion of Tellor's dev-share. As a decentralized protocol with no admin key, it's important that Tellor grows more and more community driven. A robust community of contributors makes us stronger. This is the reason our motto is **We Are Tellor**.

## Telliot - the tellior.io tasker

This is the main CLI of the project and it is written in golang and it includes different features like - staking, mining, database etc. If that sounds exciting, there's plenty to work on and we're willing to put money toward your efforts! Pick one of the [Github issues](https://github.com/tellor-io/telliot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) and contact us to include it in a [Gitcoin bounty](https://gitcoin.co/tellor-io).
